    This project consists of building a HTML document that matches the appearance of mint.comâ€™s sign-up page. The page was structured into three main containers: header, main, footer. The header contains elements relevant to signing into an existing account. The main contains the actual form and any elements relevant to the context of signing up for an account and any terms and policies a user needs to be aware of. The final element, footer, contains general information about the company and provides relevant links. While we couldn't match the style perfectly to the source web-page, we managed to use placeholders that were similar enough to satisfy the needs of this project. The project itself is static and not does not function as a real form. This project was used as an exercise to recreate the User Interface of an existing form.

Therefore permission is granted to anyone who intend to use this software
